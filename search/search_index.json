Network Types Who Owns \"The Internet\" - No one Local Network doesn't mean 'small' network. They come in all sizes. Networks installed in small offices, or homes and home offices are referred to as small office/home office ( SOHO ). 1.2. Data Transmission There are severel types of data: Volunteer data: It is the data that you offer and you are aware of that this data is being collected, stored or shared. And also you are agree with it. Inferred data: This is the data thay you generate by your activities. Observed data: As the name explains itself it is the data that is observed and collected. For example, your location. Your phone always keep track of it. 1.3. Bandwidth and Throughput The rate of data transfer is usually discussed in terms of bandwidth and throughput: Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data. Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that (theoretically) can be sent accross the media in a second. Unit of Bandwidth Abbreviation Equivalence Bits per second bps 1 bps = fundamental unit of bandwidth Kilobits per second Kbps 1 Kbps = 1,000 bps = 125 bytes per second ... ... ... Throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits accross the media over a given period of time. However, due to a number of factors, throughput does not usually match the specified bandwidth. Those factors are: The amount of data being transmitted over the connection The types of data being sent The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination In an internetwork or network with multiple segments, throughput cannot be faster than the slowest link of the path from sending device to the receiving device. Even if all or most of the segments have high bandwidth, it will only take one segment in the path with lower bandwidth to create a slowdown of the throughput of the entire network. Module 2: Network Components, Types, and Connections 2.1. Clients and Servers All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts . 2.2. Network Components The network infrastructure contains three categories of hardware components: End devices Intermediate devices Network media 2.3. ISP Connectivity Options An Internet Service Provider (ISP) provides the link between the home network and the internet. Many ISPs also offer services such as Web hosting, FTP hosting, Voice Over IP, automated backup and so on. Module 3: Wireless and Mobile Networks 3.1.
